								<p class="animate-box text-center" style="font-size: 21px"><b><i>"Tipsy"</i></b></p>
								<p class="animate-box">Here I am, in the middle of nowhere, gazing at the glittering night sky and stressing my deoxygenated brain cells to find an answer to the trickiest of the philosophical question of this century! What is free will? Are our actions completely ours, or are they governed by some mystical set of rules? Is the universe around me real, and if it is, why does it exist? “Bro, it’s pretty late already, let’s leave” -- the bubble of philosophy, where I was dwelling for the past 1 hour, has now suddenly collapsed by the faint voice of my dear friend/caretaker for the night, who apparently doesn’t want me to miss my classes tomorrow.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">8 hours later…</p>
								<p class="animate-box"><i>Knock! Knock!</i> “Alive out there?” Am I? I can’t feel my fingers, and the unremitting buzz in my head is driving me crazy. I reached out for my phone to check the time. It's 8:50 AM. Damn!</p>
								<p class="animate-box">While I race against time to get ready for my classes (which shall commence at 9:00 AM sharp), let me tell you a bit about myself:</p>
								<p class="animate-box">I am Ishaan. As far as my appearance is concerned, I don’t look anything special at all; close your eyes and try to picture the face of a very average Indian guy in his 20s… yup, that’s pretty much me. Now, I believe I am not quite living up to the expectations of a typical Indian parent; most of it comes from the fact that I am studying basic sciences. Yes. Basic sciences. Not Engineering. And that has been the prime topic of discussion with anyone my parents introduce me to, for the past couple of years.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">To be honest, there is nothing further to know about me actually. Nothing worth mentioning anyway.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">Back to the real world…</p>
								<p class="animate-box">Adapt. Improvise. Overcome. Keeping this in mind, and with sheer training and hard work, we have made ourselves capable of getting ready in the least possible time. Yes. You guessed it right. I made it to the class, at the expense of every pair of eyes inside those four walls giving me a spooky look as I trudged my way to my seat. Or at least, that’s what it felt like. There is a downside of entering late; seats are limited, and so are your choices. Ideally, I would have placed myself beside Dhruv, but since that’s not an option, I settled at the last row.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">The buzz in my head has now evolved into an uncomfortable constant throbbing. By now, it has become obvious that I was ‘kinda tipsy’ last night. Not drunk. Tipsy. People say the effects of getting tipsy vary from person to person. I believe, of all the possible effects of alcohol, I was endowed with the worst one: The Curse of Memory Loss. It’s not the “memories in bits and pieces” kind of memory loss, rather it’s the “total wipe-out”, which is horrifying in its own way. I mean, if you think about it, it’s almost what Travis must have felt like in Fight Club (although I concede that my situation isn’t that critical). This is where Dhruv comes in; he is well- equipped, both emotionally and physically, to tackle with my alter-ego after it is summoned.</p>
